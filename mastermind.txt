					--MASTERMIND GAME--

1- The game have the following logic:
	* Have an array of colors

	* Make a combination of those colors, 4 random colors and the player should guess the combination in the exact colors order

	* The game will point in each guess if the player has a right color in the same spot as in the original generated colors combination

	* The player have 12 rounds 


2- The player have an option to make his own manual combination so the game at the very beginning will ask the player if he wants an automatically generated combination or if he wants to set it manually...the rest of the above logic stays the same in both scenarios
